# Breakout Reflection
## Prototype 1
For the first prototype, I wanted to implement power-ups in breakout, which is what this prototype was about. I wanted to create something that could give the player some control over what happens on the board besides the paddle movement. From this prototype, I learned a few things about rigidbody behavior and how it is controlled, especially when it comes to collisions.

During the playtest, I learned that relying on Unity physics is not great since it had a lot of unexpected behaviors when the ball hit the bricks. Furthermore, I got a better understanding of what players may find valuable when it comes to using power-ups, and I also learned something about the input system in Unity in terms of how GetAxis differs from GetAxisRaw.
